      Isolating Together is a movement of everyday people who have grown tired of the cynicism, frustration, and
      loneliness overwhelming our society. We are coming together to build a one-stop-shop for hope and support–a place
      that channels all this negative energy into working to make things better. How?
    </div>
    <div class="body-text my-5">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Acting Together:</b> By taking on approachable action items, we will uplift ourselves and our neighbors
          through collective volunteerism and mass demands for better.</li>
        <li><b>Creating Together:</b> By providing an outlet for people to share their creative work, we can replace the
          negative emotions holding us back with a spirit of comfort and love, all while supporting our artists and
          creators.</li>
        <li><b>Community Building: </b>By being a part of this community, we are being hands-on in constructive and
          creative ways. We are breaking down any artificial barriers that make us feel so hopeless and alone–we are
          uniting locally, regionally, and nationally in a positive movement, even while we might be physically apart.

      We are a group of college students from all across the country who are taking on the deep cynicism, frustration,
      and pain ravaging our society. There have been long-standing, structural issues in our nation that have led to our
      unequal,
      atomized response to this virus, which reflects who exactly is <a
        href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-covid-assault-black-brown.html">disproportionately impacted by the
        virus.</a> We <b>know</b> that a large majority of people know we haven’t faced this crisis properly, and
      <b>know</b> that some people are being hurt by this way
      more than others are. We are creating a national, people-powered (not-for-profit!) movement to rally this mass of
      people who know we can do better. It’s easy to feel frustrated about things. It’s less easy to do something about
      them, especially
      when there’s no clear mission bringing us together. We’re here to provide it.
    </div>
    <div class="body-text my-5">
      We’re building something that brings us together, fosters hope and support, and gives us real, actionable things
      we can do to make things better. Our broad goal is to bring as many people to our table as possible, particularly
      so we can rally
      around the creation of something like the <a
        href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/roadmaptopandemicresilience_updated_4.20.20_0.pdf">Pandemic
        Testing Board</a>–a program to bring about massive testing and contact tracing, all while creating thousands
      upon thousands of jobs. We want to lobby for this sort-of mass action as the only
      appropriate response to such a national crisis, all while using our voices to hold any mass action to account. We
      want to ensure none of these projects discriminate against, or endanger, any populations, especially given the
      knowledge that
      certain populations are already facing heightened threats to this crisis.
    </div>
    <div class="body-text my-5">
      To help make this vision a reality, please be sure to take part in the components of our site: volunteer through
      Acting Together (link), uplift us through Creating Together (link), and inspire others through Inspiring Together
      (link). And
      importantly, we need help spreading the word. Keep up to date with our movement on Facebook, Twitter, and
      Instagram. Share our movement with those who trust you most: friends, family, and neighbors. Our ambitions are
      high, but the moment
      demands it. Together, we can create a real movement of hope, love, and support. We can do this.
