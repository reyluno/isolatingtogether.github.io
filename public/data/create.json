When the effects of COVID became clear, I wanted to leave it unfinished because my senior year felt unfinished. But I pushed through these feelings to complete at least one aspect of my painting. I looked around my living room for the one item I would paint. I decided to finish the couch because of how valuable it was to the senior year I did have. I spent so many days and nights talking and laughing on that couch with my friends. The couch symbolizes the completeness of the community I\u2019ve found at Columbia. It feels like the only thing that I really walked away with, so it\u2019s fitting that it was the only thing finished in the painting.
