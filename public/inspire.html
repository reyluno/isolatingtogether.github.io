          </a>
          <p class="card-text">Cooperation Jackson is a Jackson, Mississippi-based cooperative network with the vision of uplifting underserved communities by providing an alternative to capitalism. Focused primarily on empowering Black and Latinx
            communities, the goal of the cooperative is to establish four intrinsically connected and dependent organizations: “a federation of local worker cooperatives, a cooperative incubator, a cooperative education and training center (the
            Kuwasi Balagoon Center for Economic Democracy and Development), and a cooperative bank or financial institution.” Cooperation Jackson envisions a democratized economy and society, established by and for the workers and built on equity and
            sustainability.</p>

          <p class="card-text">This twitter thread by journalist Anne Helen Peterson shows photos from dozens of protests across the country, from cities with populations in the hundreds of thousands to towns with populations under 1,000. The
            powerful imagery and wide-sweeping nature of these protests are important to remember given the media’s all-too-common focus on major cities. Peterson’s thread hammers home the message that this is truly a national, even global movement,
            one primarily rooted in peace and a dominant need for systemic change.

    <div class="body-text">There’s a lot of important work ahead: from volunteering on the ground and making phone
      calls, to striving towards our broader goal of creating thousands of jobs for people to produce and
      carry out tests, and
      contact trace. In order to make our work as effective as possible, we need to make sure everyone knows about this
      movement, and that we bring as many people into our vision as possible. Here’s a few ways to help make this
      happen.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="container my-5">
    <div class="section-header my-3">Bringing People In</div>
    <div class="body-text">There are a few main things to focus on when sharing our mission with others:
      <ul>
        <li>We are a movement of love and solidarity. We are among the vast majority of people who are frustrated with
          how things have been, who care deeply about the welfare of others, and who know we can make things better–for
          everyone–if we work
          together.</li>
        <li>We have three main functions:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>bring people to the work they can do right in their own communities,</li>
          <li>unite people across the country behind national objectives, namely creating hundreds of thousands of jobs
            to successfully mass test and contact trace everyone in this country</li>
          <li>cultivate a spirit of compassion and love, through our philosophy and more directly through the art
            created by our neighbors
          </li>

        <b>Write to your local newspaper.</b> This is a national movement being built in a country that is fractured in
        more ways than one. The best way to overcome these fractures is to make sure that every person in every
        community in this country knows about what we are fighting for. Go to your local newspaper’s website and find a
        contact or letter-to-the-editor page, and write about what this movement means to you. Don’t worry about the
        data, numbers, or technicalities–that’s where this site comes into play. What we need is for YOUR voice to be
        heard. There are millions of people out there looking for a sign of hope–a sign of people caring for each other.
        Be the one to give the people in your community that hope.
      </div>
      <div class="body-text my-5">
        <b>Creating a local online community.</b> Facebook groups are a super easy way to organize people around common
        goals. Heck, even in our national volunteer effort bank, we highlight multiple local and regional facebook
        groups dedicated towards things like making masks. If you feel like your community is in need of something,
        chances are other people think so too! Make a community online group to begin filling in that gap, and invite
        all your friends, family, and neighbors to contribute. Be sure to contact us so we can add it to our bank and
        help spread the word for you!
      </div>
      <div class="body-text">
        <b>Sharing our movement on social media.</b> Again, the only way we can hope for success is if as many people as
        possible are aware of our movement and its goals. The more people who know about us, the more people who will be
        a part of it. Lucky for us, here you are, reading this right now. You are a part of this world just as much as
        anyone else–you have a voice, and you have people who care about what you have to say. An easy way for you to
        help make this vision happen is by sharing our message with the world. Use your platform for hope.
      </div>
      <hr class="new3 my-5">
      </hr>
      <div class="body-text my-5">Every letter-to-the-editor, every small, simple community action, and every share is a
        contribution to this movement. We are excited for you to be a part of something great–great because you are a
        part of it.
