This piece captures the sentiment of the destination as the journey. This sculpture is made of repurposed pedal clips from a bicycle, spray painted and drawn on with the aim of characterizing mental health to be a journey (and not so much an objective), as a simple undercurrent to a fundamentally complex and florid topic. This piece demonstrates resiliency in subject matter and is metacognitive in form: these pedal clips, crucially, are tools, that allow a rider to travel far and wide, no matter how uncomfortable or riddled the journey may be.", "website": "https://raoshilpa.github.io/"}, "frfrzosl": {"artist": "Ruba Nadar", "url": "RubaNadar2.jpeg", "title": "Unseen/Untitled I, Acrylic paint, Oil paint, oil\npastel and wool thread on linen", "tags": "blue, yellow, thread", "description": "This piece came about from an\nexperimental exploration of layers, the building and\nremoving of them using Egyptian hieroglyphics as\nbase shapes.

When the effects of COVID became clear, I wanted to leave it unfinished because my senior year felt unfinished. But I pushed through these feelings to complete at least one aspect of my painting. I looked around my living room for the one item I would paint. I decided to finish the couch because of how valuable it was to the senior year I did have. I spent so many days and nights talking and laughing on that couch with my friends. The couch symbolizes the completeness of the community I\u2019ve found at Columbia.
