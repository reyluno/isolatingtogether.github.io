This piece captures the sentiment of the destination as the journey. This sculpture is made of repurposed pedal clips from a bicycle, spray painted and drawn on with the aim of characterizing mental health to be a journey (and not so much an objective), as a simple undercurrent to a fundamentally complex and florid topic. This piece demonstrates resiliency in subject matter and is metacognitive in form: these pedal clips, crucially, are tools, that allow a rider to travel far and wide, no matter how uncomfortable or riddled the journey may be.", "website": "https://raoshilpa.github.io/"}, "zostxeyu": {"email": "dylangabrielart@gmail.com", "artist": "Dylan Gabriel", "url": "DylanGabriel1.jpg", "title": "BOLD", "tags": "Oil painting, cardinal, BOLD", "description": "This piece was part of a series in the sustained investigation of my AP studio art course that explored the feelings of freedom and power, while also featuring animals and a bright palette.

I looked around my living room for the one item I would paint. I decided to finish the couch because of how valuable it was to the senior year I did have. I spent so many days and nights talking and laughing on that couch with my friends. The couch symbolizes the completeness of the community I\u2019ve found at Columbia.
